# Quantitative Analysis Toolkit
This repository is a structured collection of **end-to-end quantitative finance projects** designed to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world financial systems.
The projects follow a **progressive roadmap** — starting from raw market data handling and exploratory analysis, and gradually moving toward factor models, portfolio construction, risk management, and basic trading strategies. The focus is not just on results, but on **process, assumptions, and system design**, mirroring how quantitative research and trading teams operate in practice.

Each project is self-contained and emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, and financial intuition.
